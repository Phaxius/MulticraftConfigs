# MulticraftConfigs
These files are multicraft .jar.conf files used by multicraft to import custom jars allowing you to choose them from the list of server types within multicraft.  Paper and Fabric both have a direct download to their release jars so these are the two types of servers I have made configs for.  See https://www.multicraft.org/site/docs/conf for a rundown of how these files work so you can adapt them to your own purpose if necessary.  If you need a specific .jar.conf configuration and want me to set it up and host it here I don't mind doing so if time permits.  Note that spigot and forge don't have direct links to download the jar files so they will not work in quite the same way so that's why I don't have those confgs available.  For for spigot you have to go through the build/install procedure to get the jar file and set your server settings in multicraft to look for it in either server jar directory or server root directory.  You will then also have to make sure to put the jar file in the respective directory and type the jar filename in server settings where it lets you type the jar name and select spigot from the list. I haven't actually set up a forge server in multicraft so am not sure exactly how to get it working.
